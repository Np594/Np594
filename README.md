Hi, I’m @Np594, I'm 22 years old, and very enthusiastic about programming
I’m currently working towards a BEng in Robotics and AI at The University of Hertfordshire.
I’m interested in programming, especially computer vision.

I have already started working on some of my projects, which will start to appear on here soon.
I have already made use of computer vision and machine learning in my gesture-controlled UI, which I intend to develop much further and fix some of the current bugs.

As part of my course at university, I have also designed, 3D printed, wired and programmed multiple robots, 
which can be seen here (https://photos.app.goo.gl/YJNPbgZzXgg4zSNp7)
