Hi, I’m @Np594, I'm 22 years old, and very enthusiastic about programming
I have recently graduated with a first-class honours BEng degree in Robotics and AI at The University of Hertfordshire.
I’m interested in programming, especially computer vision.

I have completed multiple projects utilising different programming languages, most of which can be seen on here

As part of my course at university, I have also designed, 3D printed, wired and programmed multiple robots, 
which can be seen here (https://photos.app.goo.gl/YJNPbgZzXgg4zSNp7)
