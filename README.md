ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Np594, I'm 20 years old, and very enthusiastic about programming
Iâ€™m currently working towards a BEng in Robotics and AI at The University of hertfordshire.
Iâ€™m interested in programming especially game development, AR and VR applications.

I have already started working on some of my own projects which will start to appear on here soon.
I have already made use of computer vision and machine learning in my gesture controlled UI
which I intend to develop much further and fix some of the current bugs.
